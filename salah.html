  <h1> Who is Salah?
  <p>  M.Salah is head of Terrorism.
    Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence for political or religious purposes.
    It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants
    (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel).
    The terms "terrorist" and "terrorism" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century
    but gained mainstream popularity in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland, the Basque Country and Palestine.
    The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. in 2001.
